  description: "### About Infrastructure API\n\n**Base URL:** **<u>https://api.emma.ms/external</u>**\n\
    \n This **Infrastructure API** is for managing the emma cloud infrastructure within\
    \ a project. The API enables you to view, create, edit, and delete _Virtual machines,\
    \ Spot instances, Applications, Kubernetes clusters, SSH keys, Security groups,\
    \ and Backup policies_. For creating the resources you can use the endpoints with\
    \ the dictionaries: _Data centers, Locations, Providers, Operating systems, Virtual\
    \ machines configurations, Spot instances configurations, Kubernetes clusters\
    \ configurations._\n\n ### Authentication\n\n #### 1. Create service application\n\
    \n To access the API, enter your project, navigate to **Settings** > **Service\
    \ Apps**, and create a service application. Select the access level **Read**,\
    \ **Operate**, or **Manage**.\n\n - **Read** - only GET methods are allowed in\
    \ the API.\n\n - **Operate** - some operations are allowed with the resources\
    \ (e.g. _Start, Reboot,_ and _Shutdown_ of the Virtual machines).\n\n - **Manage**\
    \ - full creating, updating, and deleting of the resources is allowed.\n\n\n ####\
    \ 2. Get access token\n\n - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in the\
    \ service application.\n - Send an API request to the endpoint **/issue-token**\
    \ as specified in the **Authentication** section of the API documentation. You\
    \ will receive access and refresh tokens in the response.\n\n _For Linux / Mac:_\n\
    \ ```\n curl -X POST https://api.emma.ms/external/v1/issue-token \\\n -H \"Content-Type:\
    \ application/json\" \\\n -d '{\"clientId\": \"YOUR-CLIENT-ID\", \"clientSecret\"\
    : \"YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET\"}'\n ```\n _For Windows:_\n ```\n curl -X POST https://api.emma.ms/external/v1/issue-token\
    \ ^\n -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" ^\n -d \"{\\\"clientId\\\": \\\"YOUR-CLIENT-ID\\\
    \", \\\"clientSecret\\\": \\\"YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET\\\"}\"\n ```\n\n #### 3. Use\
    \ access token in requests\n The Bearer access token is a text string, included\
    \ in the request header, for example:\n\n _For Linux / Mac:_\n ```\n curl -X GET\
    \ https://api.emma.ms/external/v1/locations -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN-HERE\"\
    \n ```\n\n Use this token for the API requests. \n\n #### 4. Refresh token\n The\
    \ access token will expire in 10 minutes. A new access token may be created using\
    \ the refresh token (without Client ID and Client Secret).\n\n To get a new access\
    \ token send a request to the **/refresh-token** endpoint:\n\n\n _For Linux /\
    \ Mac:_\n ```\n curl -X POST https://api.emma.ms/external/v1/refresh-token \\\n\
    \ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n -d '{\"refreshToken\": \"YOUR-REFRESH-TOKEN\"\
    }'\n ```    \n\n ### Possible response status codes\n\n We use standard HTTP response\
    \ codes to show the success or failure of requests.\n\n `2xx` - successful responses.\n\
    \n `4xx` - client error responses (the response contains an explanation of the\
    \ error).\n\n `5xx` - server error responses.\n\n The API uses the following status\
    \ codes:\n\n | Status Code | Description                  | Notes            \
    \                                                      |\n |-------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\
    \ | 200         | OK                           | The request was successful. \
    \                                            |\n | 201         | Created     \
    \                 | The object was successfully created. This code is only used\
    \ with objects that are created immediately.\n | 204         | No content    \
    \               | A successful request, but there is no additional information\
    \ to send back in the response body (in a case when the object was deleted). \
    \ \n | 400         | Bad Request                  | The request could not be understood\
    \ by the server. Incoming parameters might not be valid. |\n | 401         | Unauthorized\
    \            | The client is unauthenticated. The client must authenticate itself\
    \ to get the requested response. |\n | 403         | Forbidden               \
    \    | The client does not have access rights to the content.\n | 404        \
    \ | Not Found                    | The requested resource is not found.      \
    \                              |\n | 409         | Conflict | This response is\
    \ sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the object (e.g. deleting\
    \ the security group with the compute instances in it).|\n | 422         | Unprocessable\
    \ Content   | The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to\
    \ incorrect field values (e.g. creation of a virtual machine in the non-existent\
    \ data center).  |\n | 500         | Internal server Error                 | The\
    \ server could not return the representation due to an internal server error.\

    Includes two endpoints for obtaining access tokens for authentication in the current API. The first endpoint enables you to get an access token and a refresh token. To send a request, you first need to create a Service application in your project (in the Settings section). After creating the application, you will get a Client ID and a Client Secret. Use them in your API request body to get the access and refresh tokens.

    The second endpoint is used for getting a new access token using the refresh token. Since the access token can expire in a few minutes, you can generate a new access token without providing the Client ID and Client Secret.

    When creating virtual machines, spot instances, or Kubernetes clusters, you need to provide the desired hardware configurations. These configurations include CPU, CPU type, RAM, volume size, and volume type. Different cloud providers offer various configurations in different data centers. Therefore, before creating any compute instance, you need to verify the available configurations.

    Use these three endpoints as references for available configurations for virtual machines, spot instances, and Kubernetes clusters. You can search the available configurations by different parameters (provider, location, data center, cloud network type, CPU, CPU type, RAM, volume size, volume type, and price).

    When you find an appropriate configuration, provide the hardware parameters in the endpoint for creating or editing a virtual machine, spot instance, or Kubernetes cluster.
  name: Compute instances configurations
- description: |
    Data centers from cloud providers. The data center ID is necessary for creating compute instances. Use data center endpoints to find the provider's data centers.
  name: Data centers

        Returns an access token and a refresh token for this API. The bearer access token enables you to get access and send requests to the endpoints in this API.

        To get the tokens, you need to send a Client ID and a Client Secret, which you can obtain from the Service application in your project. First, create a Service app in your project (Project -> Settings -> Service apps).

        To manage access rights to the API, select an appropriate access level for your app when creating the service app - **Read**, **Operate,** or **Manage**.

        The Bearer access token is a text string, included in the request header, for example:

        ```
        curl -X GET https://api.emma.ms/external/v1/locations -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN-HERE"

        The method for editing a Managed Kubernetes cluster enables you to delete and add new worker nodes and autoscaling groups, as well as change the settings of existing autoscaling groups. You can only edit a cluster when it is in "ACTIVE" status. To select hardware configurations for worker nodes, use the /v1/kubernetes-configs endpoint.

        When editing a Kubernetes cluster, you can only add or delete worker nodes, but you cannot change the name or configuration of existing worker nodes. If you want to keep a node when editing a cluster, simply specify its ID in the 'workerNodes' object. All other fields in 'workerNodes' are ignored for existing nodes and are not required. If you want to delete a node, remove its ID.

        When you create a new node, all fields in the 'workerNodes' object (except ID) are required. Do not add the ID field for a new node.

        Please note that the spotMarkup field is ignored for the GCP provider.

        When you delete an autoscaling group with existing worker nodes, the worker nodes are also deleted.

        During the changes, the cluster status will change to "ENV_DEVELOPMENT." Nodes undergoing changes will be displayed with a "BUSY" status. When the changes are successfully applied, the cluster will transition back to the "ACTIVE" status, and the nodes will be in the "ON" status.

        This method creates a security group.

        A security group refers to a set of rules that determine what network traffic is allowed to enter or leave a particular compute instance. It acts as a virtual firewall, controlling inbound and outbound traffic based on predefined rules.

        Security groups operate based on predefined rules that allow traffic based on specified criteria, such as source IP address, destination IP address, port number, and protocol.

        When creating a security group, provide its name and a set of inbound and outbound rules. You can only define rules that allow traffic, not deny it. All traffic is denied except for explicitly allowed traffic.

        Security groups control TCP, SCTP, GRE, ESP, AH, UDP, and ICMP protocols, or all the selected protocols at once.

        After creating a security group, a set of default rules is added to the security group. These rules are immutable, and you can't edit or delete them.

        All traffic in the selected protocol is allowed if the IP range in a rule is set to `0.0.0.0/0`.

        This method adds a compute instance to the selected security group.

        A security group refers to a set of rules that determine what network traffic is allowed to enter or leave a particular compute instance. It acts as a virtual firewall, controlling inbound and outbound traffic based on predefined rules.

        Security groups operate based on predefined rules that allow traffic based on specified criteria, such as source IP address, destination IP address, port number, and protocol.

        Any compute instance always uses some security group since its creation. Adding a compute instance to a security group effectively means moving it from one security group to another. When adding a compute instance to a new security group, it is automatically removed from the previous security group.

        \ for the Linux spot instance using the `/v1/ssh-keys` endpoint.\n\n4. Select\
        \ an operating system using the `/v1/operating-systems` endpoint.\n\n5. Choose\
        \ one of the cloud network types: _multi-cloud, isolated,_ or _default_. Choose\
        \ the _multi-cloud_ network type if you need to connect compute instances\

        \nThe spot instance market operates on a bidding system. Your specified price\
        \ acts as your bid in this market. If your bid is higher than the current\
        \ spot price, your instance request will likely be fulfilled. However, if\

        This method creates an SSH key that can be used for Linux compute instance creation. An SSH key can be created in two ways: generated by emma or imported by the user.

        If you want to **generate** a key, specify two fields: name and keyType (RSA or ED25519). The key will be generated, and you will receive a private key in the response. The private key will be shown only once, so copy and save it to connect to the Linux compute instances.

        If you want to **import** an existing SSH key, specify two fields: name and key. In the key field, insert your public SSH key as a string. It will be imported.

        This method creates a subnetwork.
        To create a subnetwork, consider the following parameters:
        1. Select a data center using the `/v1/data-centers` endpoint. The data center determines the provider and location of the subnetwork.
        2. Specify the IP address range (optional). Subnetwork prefix values can have exceptions depending on that provider and must be in ranges: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255, 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255.

        Specific conditions are depending on the provider:
        - GCP: 2 first and 2 last addresses are reserved by the provider. Notice that VMs in different GCP subnetworks can be connected to each other.
        - Azure: 4 first and the last ones are reserved by the provider.
        - AWS: 3 first and the last one are reserved by the provider.

        3. Specify the network size (required). Network size must be: for DigitalOcean /28-/16, for Gcore /24-/16, for Azure /29 - /2, for AWS /28 - /16

        This method creates a virtual machine according to the specified parameters.

        To create a virtual machine, follow these steps:

        1. Select a data center using the `/v1/data-centers` endpoint. The data center determines the provider and location of the virtual machine.

        2. Select an available hardware configuration for the virtual machine using the `/v1/vms-configs` endpoint.

        3. Select an SSH key for the Linux virtual machine using the `/v1/ssh-keys` endpoint.

        4. Select an operating system using the `/v1/operating-systems` endpoint.

        5. Choose one of the cloud network types: _multi-cloud, isolated,_ or _default_. Choose the _multi-cloud_ network type if you need to connect compute instances from different providers.

        Providers support the following types of networks:
        - AWS - multi-cloud, isolated, default

        When creating virtual machines you need to provide the desired hardware configurations. These configurations include CPU, CPU type, RAM, volume size, and volume type. Different cloud providers offer various configurations in different data centers. Therefore, before creating any compute instance, you need to verify the available configurations.

        Use this endpoint as a reference for available configurations for virtual machines. You can search the available configurations by different parameters (provider, location, data center, cloud network type, CPU, CPU type, RAM, volume size, volume type, and price).

        When you find an appropriate configuration, provide the hardware parameters in the endpoint for creating or editing a virtual machine.
